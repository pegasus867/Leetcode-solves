1768. Merge Strings Alternately

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

class Solution {
public:
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
        string t="";
        int i=0;int j=0;
        while(i<word1.length()&&j<word2.length()){
            t=t+word1[i];
            t=t+word2[j];
            i++;
            j++;
        }
        while(i<word1.length()){
            t=t+word1[i];
            i++;
        }
        while(j<word2.length()){
            t=t+word2[j];
            j++;
        }
        return t;
    }
};
